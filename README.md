# UPI-Data-Analysis
## Project Objective
To create an interactive UPI data analysis report using Power BI that visualizes transaction trends, city-wise statistics, and dynamic KPIs, enabling users to uncover insights into payment behaviors, regional performance, and monthly patterns for informed decision-making.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/CASKEDOW77/UPI-Data-Analysis/blob/main/UPI%2BTransactions.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
- Which month recorded the highest and lowest transaction amounts based on the plotted monthly trend?
- How do transaction amounts and remaining balances compare across cities using the city-wise table visualization?
- How do transaction patterns vary across device types (e.g., mobile vs. desktop), provide slicer?
- How do age groups and genders influence UPI transactions and payment methods, provide filter through the slicers?

## Project Insight
- Identified monthly transaction trends with peaks in specific months (e.g., May and October) using a line chart.
- Highlighted city-wise transactions by amounts and remaining balances across different currencies for better regional analysis.- The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is 
  max contributing (~50%) and buys the most products.
- Enabled users to analyze transactions filtered by parameters such as age groups, device types, gender, payment methods, and transaction purposes.
- Implemented bookmarks and a bookmark navigator to allow seamless switching between KPIs, such as viewing transaction amounts and remaining balances in different chart types (line chart, column chart) for better comparison.
- Visualized data interactively using slicers and bookmark navigation for seamless KPI comparison.
